# 1️⃣ User Input : 
- The user types a message or question in the chatbot interface (Your message text box).
- Example: "How are you?"

# 2️⃣ API Call to Gemini :
- When the user sends a message, the backend code makes an API call to Google Gemini (via Gemini API).
- The input message is sent as a prompt to the Gemini API for generating a response.

# 3️⃣ AI Response Generation :
- The Gemini API processes the input and generates a relevant response based on its large language model (LLM).
- Example Response: "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How are you today?"

# 4️⃣ Display Response :
- The AI-generated response is displayed in the chat interface.
- The user sees a conversational reply, just like chatting with an AI assistant.
